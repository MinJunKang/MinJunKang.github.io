I"—<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> and Prof. <a href="http://vi.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Kuk-Jin Yoon</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>. 
Previously, I earned my M.S. in <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a> (Feb. 2021) and B.S. in <a href="https://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/ee/index.do" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/sc/index.jsp" target="_blank">Yonsei University</a> (Feb. 2019). </p>

<p>My research focuses on data-hungry problems (e.g., semi-supervised learning) and bias in data labels (e.g., class-imbalance) for deep neural networks. 
I also have a broad interest in learning general representations (e.g., self-supervised learning) and improving model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., domain generalization).</p>

  My research focused on low level vision including 3D reconstruction using a single image from dual-pixel. Recently, I am interested in solving dense reconstruction and tracking (SLAM) using Neural Radiance Field. My research goal is to provide 3D in any environment (on device) and facilitate related fields using 3D including editing, real-time navigation. <p style="color:blue">I am currently looking for internship related to <a href="https://zju3dv.github.io/neumesh/" target="_blank">Neural Radiance Fields</a> and <a href="https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/" target="_blank">3D generative models.</a></p>
